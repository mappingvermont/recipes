- 2 Tablespoons Packed Brown Sugar
- 2 Tablespoons Cornstarch
- 2 Tablespoons Sriracha (more Or Less To Taste)
- 1 Tablespoon Minced Fresh Ginger
- 3 Tablespoons Peanut Oil

- 1 whole Yellow Bell Pepper, Seeded And Cut Into Large Chunks
- 2 whole Garlic Cloves, Minced
- 1 can (15-ounce) Baby Corn, Drained And Halved Crosswise
- 1 head Broccoli Cut Into Florets

### Instructions

1. In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sherry, brown sugar, cornstarch, sriracha, and ginger. Set aside.

2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and peppers, and stir, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute more, stirring continuously. Add the zucchini and stir it around, cooking it for 2 minutes more. Add the baby corn and broccoli and cook for a couple of minutes, then, while the veggies are still firm, pour in the sauce.

3. Stir the veggies in the sauce, cooking for 1 to 2 minutes more, or until the sauce is very thick. If it needs to be a little saucier, pour in 1/4 to 1/2 cup hot water and splash in a little more soy sauce. Serve over noodles or rice, with a sprinkling of sesame seeds.
