### Ingredients

- 2 medium Italian eggplants (about 1.5 lb)
- Kosher salt
- 2 red bell peppers
- 1 large zucchini
- 2 medium onions
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 lemon
- 1 c grated parm
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup capers
- 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 lb. cavatappi pasta
- 1.5 cups basil leaves, torn if large

### Instructions

1. Cut eggplants into 1/2" pieces. Transfer to a colander set over a medium bowl and sprinkle with 2 tsp. salt. Let sit 30 minutes.

2. Cut bell peppers and 1 large zucchini into Â½" pieces. Peel onions into thin slivers by cutting through root end. Transfer to a medium bowl.

3. Halve the cherry tomatoes. Chop garlic. Move to another bowl.

4. Squeeze the eggplant to get rid of more water.

5. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a dutch oven over high heat. Add _half_ the eggplant and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes. Put the cooked eggplant on a plate and repeat with the remaining half.

6. Scrape off any eggplant bits (no need to wipe out) and heat 1/4 cup olive oil over medium high. Add capers and red pepper flakes; cook 1 minute.

7. Bring large pot of water to a boil for pasta.

8. Add onion-pepper-zuke mix and 1.5 tsp salt to dutch oven. Cook, stirring frequently for 15 min.

9. Add garlic-tomato mix to dutch oven, reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until things really carmelize - 10 minutes.

10. Add pasta to boiling water, cook until al dente. Reserve 1 c pasta water before draining.

11. Return the eggplant to pot and cook 5 more minutes. Taste and season with salt.

12. Now the exciting part: ratatouille and pasta join forces as one. Reduce heat over sauce to low. Add drained pasta and stir to coat in sauce. Add 1 cup Parmesan, pour 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid over, then stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until a creamy sauce forms with no clumps of cheese. Add more pasta cooking liquid as necessary if pasta starts to stiffen. Remove from heat. Squeeze juice from 1/2 lemon over, then stir in 1.5 cups basil. Taste for salt and lemon juice.
