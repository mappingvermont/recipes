### Ingredients

Filling:
- 2 medium sweet potatoes
- 1 can black beans, drained
- 4 ounces / 1 cup grated Monterey Jack
- 2 ounces / 1/2 crumbled feta
- 2 small cans (4 ounces each) diced green chiles
- 1 medium jalapeño, seeded and minced
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 lime / 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
- 1/4 teaspoon salt, more to taste
- Black pepper

Sauce:

- 2 cups / 16 ounces salsa verde
- 10 flour tortillas
- 4 ounces / 1 cup grated Monterey Jack 

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, then slice the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise and coat the flat sides lightly with olive oil. Place the sweet potatoes flat-side down on the baking sheet. Bake until they’re tender and cooked through, about 30 to 35 minutes.
2. Lightly cover the bottom of the 9 by 13-inch baking dish in salsa verde.In a medium mixing bowl, combine all of the remaining filling ingredients.
3. Once the sweet potatoes are cooked through and cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides with a spoon. Discard the potato skins, and lightly mash the sweet potatoes with a fork or the back of a spoon.
4. Stir the mashed sweet potato into the bowl of filling, and season to taste with additional salt (I added ¼ teaspoon) and pepper.
5. Spread about ½ cup filling down the center each tortilla, then wrap both sides over the filling and place it in your baking dish. Repeat for all of the tortillas.
6. Top with the remaining salsa verde and cheese. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until sauce is bubbling and the cheese is lightly golden.
